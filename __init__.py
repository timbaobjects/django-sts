"""
    Strict Transport Security is a mechanism that enables a web server or
    web application to tell supporting browsers to always use HTTPS when 
    communicating with them.

    Most users or web browsers tend to always visit the HTTP version of 
    a website before being redirected by the website to the HTTPS version. 
    This could leave the user vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks 
    like phishing or session hijacking involving a compromised router. 

    By explicitly telling browsers to always contact a given server over 
    HTTPS, such clever attacks can be limited.

    This middleware is built to automatically include the STS headers in 
    outgoing responses from a django-based web application.

    To enable this middleware, simply include it in you MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES 
    setting in the project settings after the standard middleware:

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'django-sts.STSMiddleware',
        ...
    )

    The following parameters in your settings file can be used to change 
    the values sent out in the headers.

    STS_MAXAGE: Which specifies the maximum duration the browser is allowed 
        to cache the setting to always use HTTPS for this web app. The value is 
        specified in number of seconds.
        
        Example:
        STS_MAXAGE = 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 # specifies a maximum age of 30 days

    STS_INCLUDESUBDOMAINS: This setting specifies whether the feature also 
        applies to subdomains under this domain. The value is boolean

        Example:
        STS_INCLUDESUBDOMAINS = True
